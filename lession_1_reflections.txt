version control:

Any system that allowing versioning including store, retrieve and share

using "diff" command helps compare two files
the differences between the old and new files are highlighted

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
---It helps to track the changes made over time and go back to a previous version if required

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
---Saving automatically avoids any inadvertent miss by the user whereas manual commit gives more control to manage the commits

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
---Because Git is manual 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

---git log lists all the commits made to the file
---git diff can be used to compare the differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
---I could easily debug the code by going to previous versions of the code and figuring out where the error happened

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
---I want to start using it for better manage my version control
